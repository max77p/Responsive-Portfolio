            <p class="bioText">Hi! Welcome to my page! My name is Shan Indrakumar and I am a developer but definitely not your average one.
                I come from an Accounting background - 10 years of it! But along the way in my wonderful career in commerical
                real estate working for Canada's largest REIT, I realized it was time to pursue my passions and learn the
                language of the future. So at the age of 30 I began sourcing everything I can on the web to teach myself
                code.
            </p>

            <p class="bioText">It was a bumpy ride at first, because well, I didn't know where to start. I must admit I was stuck and lost many
                many times over. But persistence as with anything in my life was the key. I remained focus and kept hacking
                away until I landed on a site called freecodecamp. I began following the curriculum and along with some small
                courses on coursera and codeacademy backed by great advice from friends and strangers in the industry I developed
                a clearer picture of where I was heading.
            </p>

            <p class="bioText"> 3 years later, I have a strong grasp on HTML, CSS and continue to develop on prior strengths in Javascript. As
                I prepare to enter the industry full time, my journey has landed me at one of the best schools in Canada
                and enrolled in the inaugural Full Stack Development bootcamp. I look forward to this final challenge in
                my pursuit and excited about what the future has in store!
            </p>
